By understanding these factors, businesses can implement strategies to improve customer retention.

## Features:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for churn prediction.
- Use of machine learning models to calculate churn probability.
- In-depth analysis of historical customer data to uncover patterns and trends.
- Visualization of churn trends to help businesses make informed decisions.
